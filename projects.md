## Ongoing Work

Questions and lines of inquiry I’m actively tracking. These may develop into essays, documentation, or remain open.

- What accountability looks like when power is exercised through infrastructure rather than overt authority
- How legal legitimacy can coexist with democratic harm — and what repair actually requires
