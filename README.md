## Hi — I’m Jess 👋

I’m a writer, speaker, and consultant focused on leadership, systems, and the human impact of decision-making in complex environments.

This repository powers my personal website, which serves as a home base for my writing, speaking work, and longer-term projects. The site is intentionally simple and text-forward — a place to think clearly, name patterns, and explore how people navigate power, responsibility, and values inside real systems.

My work draws from experience across corporate, nonprofit, and humanitarian contexts, including human rights consulting with a focus on anti-trafficking efforts and protecting the rights of children in humanitarian settings. I’m particularly interested in how systems shape behavior — and what it takes to lead with integrity when the answers aren’t obvious.

I also work as a life coach and neurodivergent coach, supporting people who are navigating leadership, change, burnout, and identity in environments that weren’t designed with them in mind.

This repo isn’t meant to be clever or complex. It’s infrastructure for public work — writing, speaking, and sense-making — and it’s built to stay out of the way.

If you’re here out of curiosity, welcome.  
If you’re here because of the work, you’re in the right place.
