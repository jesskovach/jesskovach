# Jess Kovach

**I study how institutions actually behave — not how they describe themselves — and build tools and narratives that make power, incentives, and accountability visible for the people who live inside those systems.**

## What This Is

This repository is a **hub** for my writing, projects, and ongoing work focused on how systems function in practice — especially where accountability quietly erodes and human impact is treated as an afterthought.

It connects analysis, lived experience, and building work in one place, without pretending these are separate domains.

## Writing & Analysis

I write about **institutions, power, technology, and governance** in plain language — with an emphasis on clarity over abstraction.

Current and recent work includes:
- Essays and analysis on **Substack**
- Op-ed–style writing informed by reporting, systems thinking, and lived experience
- Long-form projects examining **accountability failures** across public and private institutions

*Selected links will live here.*

## Building

I also build tools that respond to the same questions my writing explores.

Current projects include:
- **CoachCRM / Base44**  
  A system designed to make follow-through, transparency, and human-centered accountability easier to sustain in practice

My building work focuses less on novelty and more on **usability, incentives, and what people actually need systems to do**.

---

## Systems I Focus On

- **Organizational design** and leadership accountability  
- **Power dynamics** inside institutions  
- **Technology** as a force that can either obscure or clarify responsibility  
- **Governance failures** and their downstream human cost  

---

## Current Focus

- Expanding long-form writing and investigative analysis  
- Developing and refining accountability-focused tools  
- Connecting systems analysis to **real-world outcomes**, not abstractions
