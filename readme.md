# Jess Kovach

**I study how institutions actually behave — not how they describe themselves — and build tools and narratives that make power, incentives, and accountability visible for the people who live inside those systems.**

## What This Is

This repository is a **public hub** for my writing, projects, and ongoing work focused on how systems function in practice — especially where accountability quietly erodes and human impact is treated as an afterthought.

It brings together analysis, advocacy, lived experience, and building work in one place, without pretending these are separate domains.

## Writing, Advocacy & Analysis

I write about **institutions, power, gender, democracy, and governance** in plain language — prioritizing clarity, evidence, and real-world consequences over abstraction or rhetoric.

My work focuses on how legal, political, and organizational systems fail people slowly, predictably, and often by design.

Selected essays include:
- **[Why Women Are Leaving Their Marriages — and It’s Not “Quiet Quitting”](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/why-women-are-leaving-their-marriages?lli=1)**
- **[Democracy Didn’t Collapse Overnight. It Was Dismantled — Legally](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/democracy-didnt-collapse-overnight?lli=1)**
- **[Courts, Corruption, and the Cost of Looking Away](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/courts-corruption-and-the-cost-of?lli=1)**
- **[When Accountability Becomes Optional, Democracy Fails](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/when-accountability-becomes-optional?lli=1)**

In addition to public writing, I have **submitted written work and analysis to the United Nations**, focused on governance failures, accountability mechanisms, and the human cost of institutional neglect.

More writing lives on Substack and is updated regularly.

## Building (in Service of Accountability)

I also build tools that respond to the same questions my writing explores — particularly where systems break down between stated values and lived reality.

Current project:
- **[CoachCRM / Base44](https://app.jesskovach.com)**  
  A system designed to support follow-through, transparency, and human-centered accountability in practice

My building work emphasizes **usability, incentives, and ethical design** — not growth for its own sake.

## Systems I Focus On

- **Democratic institutions** and accountability failures  
- **Gender, power, and structural inequality**  
- **Organizational behavior** inside large systems  
- **Technology’s role** in obscuring or clarifying responsibility  
- **Legal and governance frameworks** that enable harm through inaction  

---

## Current Focus

- Long-form writing and public-interest analysis  
- Accountability, governance, and institutional reform  
- Connecting policy, systems, and law to lived human outcomes
