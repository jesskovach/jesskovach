# Jess Kovach

**I study how institutions actually behave — not how they describe themselves — and build tools and narratives that make power, incentives, and accountability visible for the people who live inside those systems.**

## What This Is

This repository is a **hub** for my writing, projects, and ongoing work focused on how systems function in practice — especially where accountability quietly erodes and human impact is treated as an afterthought.

It connects analysis, lived experience, and building work in one place, without pretending these are separate domains.

## Writing & Analysis

I write about **institutions, power, technology, gender, and governance** in plain language — with an emphasis on clarity over abstraction and consequences over theory.

Selected essays include:
- **[Why Women Are Leaving Their Marriages — and It’s Not “Quiet Quitting”](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/why-women-are-leaving-their-marriages?lli=1)**
- **[Democracy Didn’t Collapse Overnight. It Was Dismantled — Legally](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/democracy-didnt-collapse-overnight?lli=1)**
- **[Courts, Corruption, and the Cost of Looking Away](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/courts-corruption-and-the-cost-of?lli=1)**
- **[When Accountability Becomes Optional, Democracy Fails](https://www.jesskovach.com/p/when-accountability-becomes-optional?lli=1)**

More writing lives on Substack and is updated regularly.

## Building

I also build tools that respond to the same questions my writing explores.

Current projects include:
- **[CoachCRM / Base44](https://app.jesskovach.com)**  
  A system designed to make follow-through, transparency, and human-centered accountability easier to sustain in practice

My building work focuses less on novelty and more on **usability, incentives, and what people actually need systems to do**.

---

## Systems I Focus On

- **Organizational design** and leadership accountability  
- **Power dynamics** inside institutions  
- **Technology** as a force that can either obscure or clarify responsibility  
- **Governance failures** and their downstream human cost  

---

## Current Focus

- Expanding long-form writing and investigative analysis  
- Developing and refining accountability-focused tools  
- Connecting systems analysis to **real-world outcomes**, not abstractions
