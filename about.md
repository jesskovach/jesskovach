title: About
---

I’m Jess Kovach — a writer, researcher, and consultant focused on information integrity, education, democratic governance, and the human impact of decision-making inside complex systems.

My work examines how structural choices — in media, institutions, policy, and leadership — shape what people are able to know, learn, and contest in public life. I’m particularly interested in the downstream effects of decisions that are often treated as technical, neutral, or inevitable.

My background spans corporate, nonprofit, and humanitarian contexts, including human rights consulting with a focus on anti-trafficking efforts and protecting the rights of children in humanitarian settings.

Related work includes thematic documentation on information integrity, education, and governance submitted to UN Special Procedures.

This site serves as a home base for my writing and longer-term projects. It’s intentionally simple, text-forward, and built to support clarity over volume.

If you’re here out of curiosity, welcome.  
If you’re here because of the work, you’re in the right place.
