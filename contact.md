I’m open to thoughtful conversations about writing, speaking, consulting, and collaborative work — especially where leadership, systems, education, or governance are involved.

If you’re reaching out with a specific idea or question, a bit of context is always helpful. I read everything, even if I’m not able to respond right away.

The best way to reach me is by email:

**jessica@kovachconsultants.com**

If you found your way here through the work itself, I’m glad you did.
