Before the individual pieces, a note on how I use this space.

I write to make sense of systems that are often treated as neutral, technical, or inevitable — and to trace how those systems shape human behavior, opportunity, and harm over time. Much of this work is slow by design. Some pieces are finished arguments; others are attempts to name patterns that are still unfolding.

This site serves as a place to gather work that benefits from context and continuity. Some of what appears here has been published elsewhere; some exists only here because it doesn’t fit neatly into faster or more reactive formats.

I’m less interested in producing commentary than in building a body of work that can be returned to, cited, and questioned. If something here feels unresolved, that’s often intentional.

I use this site as a place to gather and contextualize work that may also appear elsewhere. Not everything here is new; some things are brought together because they belong in conversation with one another.
