Before the individual pieces, a note on how I use this space.

I write to make sense of systems that are often treated as neutral, technical, or inevitable — and to trace how those systems shape human behavior, opportunity, and harm over time. Much of this work is slow by design. Some pieces are finished arguments; others are attempts to name patterns that are still unfolding.

This site serves as a place to gather work that benefits from context and continuity. Some of what appears here has been published elsewhere; some exists only here because it doesn’t fit neatly into faster or more reactive formats.

I’m less interested in producing commentary than in building a body of work that can be returned to, cited, and questioned. If something here feels unresolved, that’s often intentional.

## Ongoing Work

Questions and lines of inquiry I’m actively tracking. These may develop into essays, documentation, or remain open.

- How deregulated information systems reshape public trust, education, and democratic participation
- What accountability looks like when power is exercised through infrastructure rather than overt authority
- How legal legitimacy can coexist with democratic harm — and what repair actually requires
